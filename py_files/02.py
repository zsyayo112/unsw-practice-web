# Returns the list of all lists of the form [L[i_0], ..., L[i_k]] such that:
# - i_0 < ... < i_k
# - L[i_0] < ... < L[i_k]
# - there is NO list of the form [L[j_0], ..., L[j_k']] such that:
#   * j_0 < ... < j_k'
#   * L[j_0] < ... < L[j_k']
#   * {i_0, ..., i_k} is a strict subset of {j_0, ..., j_k'}.
#
# The solutions are output in lexicographic order of the associated tuples
# (i_0, ..., i_k).
#
# Will be tested on inputs that, for some of them, are too large for a brute
# force approach to be efficient enough. Think recursively.

# You can assume that L is a list of DISTINCT integers.
